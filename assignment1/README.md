# Assignment 1: "The 6 boxes"

## Introduction
There are 6 golden boxes all positioned in circle around a gray region, as shown in figure, and a mobile robot with an end effector. The robot's characteristics are described in the README in robot-sim folder. 
The aim of the assignment is to bring all the boxes together grabbing them with the robot's end effector.

Even if it wasn't requested, I did this so that the boxes are collected in the gray region. I thought that it was the smartest way to bring toghether all the boxes, because, doing this, the robot takes advantage of the fact that they are all placed in circle so it moves less.
